//What does the following expression return?  3 + 2;

alert(3+2);

//The code adds two numbers which is 3 and 2 and gives the result 5

//W. does the following expression return? typeof (3);

alert(typeof(3));

//It returns Number which is the datatype of 3 which is number

//W. does the following expression return? typeof (3) === typeof (4.32);
alert((3) === typeof (4.32));

//It will return false because they are not of thesame datatype nor are they thesame values

//What does the following expression return? 5 / 0;
alert(5 / 0);

//It will return infinity since the result is a very large number

//Whet does the 'following expression return? 3 / "bob";

alert(3 / "bob");

//It will return Not a Number (NaN) 

//What does the following expression return? NaN === NaN;
alert( NaN === NaN);

//It will return False 

//What does the following expression return? typeof (NaN);
alert(typeof (NaN));

//It will return a Number since the data type of NaN is number

//What does the following expression return? isNaN(NaN);
alert(isNaN(NaN));

//It will return True 

//What does the following expression return? Math.pow(2, 3);
alert(Math.pow(2, 3));

//It will return 8 since this computing 2 * 2 * 2

/*Describe how the following expression assigns a variable to a value. var first_name = "cindy";

The code assigns the value "cindy" which is of a string datatype to the variable first_name*/

/*What is the value of the hello variable in the following expression? var hello;

The value can be anything depending on the datatype of the value*/

/*What does the following expression return? var y; y === "cool";

The code returns Undefined since the value of y was not defined */

//What does the following expression return? "some" + " person";
alert("some" + " person");

//The code returns some person since it concatenates the two strings

/*What does the following expression return?
var first = "Bart"
var last = "Simpson";
first " "+ last*/

//The code will not execute because of the double quotes between the variables first and last

//What does the following expression return? "cool".length;
alert("cool".length);

//The expression will return 4 because it counts the length of that string since it has 4 characters

//What does the following expression return? Explain the answer. "phat" === "phat";
alert("phat" === "phat");

/*The expression returns True, This is because we are comparing two same numbers here 
and they are of thesame datatype and have same values*/

//What does the following expression return? typeof("cats");
alert(typeof("cats"));

//The expression will return a string because the datatype of "cats" is a string

/*what does the following expression return? 3 + "bob"

The expression will return 3bob since it concatenates the two values*/

/*Round the number 4.87 to the nearest integer.

Rounding the number to the nearest integer will make it 5 */

//Divide the number 6 by the string "2" and explain the result.
    var a =6;
    var b= "2";
    var c=6/"2";
    alert(c);

/*The result of the computation give 3 , This id because in Javascript it automatically converts the 
number into the type that it needs using a set of rules, this is called type coercion*/

/*What does the following expression return? Explain the result. 3 * "bob";

The expression will return NaN. This is beacause the string "bob" does not map a number when Javascript
tries to convert it.*/

/*Declare the variables x and y.

var x ;
var y ;
Set the variable hobby to the string "programming'.

var hobby = "programming";*/

/*What does the following expression return?
var sport; sport === undefined

The expression returns Undefined , this is because the variable sports was not defined.*/

//Demonstrate that "brogrammer" has the type "string". */
